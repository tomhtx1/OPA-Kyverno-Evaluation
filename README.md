# Policy Management: OPA Gatekeeper & Kyverno Evaluation


As a cybersecurity research intern for Platform One, the purpose of this project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of Kyverno and Gatekeeper, two prominent policy management tools for Kubernetes. The goal is to analyze their respective capabilities, performance, and suitability for enforcing policies within Kubernetes clusters. This evaluation will provide valuable insights and recommendations to enhance Platform One's policy enforcement strategies, ensuring robust security, compliance, and operational efficiency in managing Kubernetes resources.



## Description

I have developed a code that pulls YAML files from the cloned Big Bang repository and analyzes them. The purpose of this project is to conduct a detailed evaluation of two prominent policy management tools for Kubernetes: Kyverno and Gatekeeper. By leveraging the extracted YAML files, this evaluation aims to compare and contrast the capabilities, performance, and suitability of Kyverno and Gatekeeper in enforcing policies within Kubernetes clusters.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Visual Studio Code (VSCode):
Integrated development environment used for writing and editing the code.
Installed YAML extension in VSCode for syntax highlighting and validation.

*Access to the Big Bang Repository:
The Big Bang repository is publicly accessible and contains the YAML files needed for analysis.
Cloned the repository locally for file access and manipulation.

* Python 3:

Used as the primary programming language for developing the code to pull and analyze YAML files.
Installed necessary Python libraries, including PyYAML for parsing YAML files.
